## Vision
Being mindful, [consuming sustainably](http://scorai.org/), sleeping and living sufficiently, as well as having enough perceived timeâ€“in an imagined [degrowth](https://degrowth.org/) society that is purposefully aided by [digital technology](http://sheetgo.com/).

I love spending time reading newspapers and playing the guitar. I like flipping through the pages of the [c't](https://www.heise.de/ct/) and [Games Aktuell](http://www.gamesaktuell.de/) magazines. I enjoy listening to the [c't uplink](https://www.heise.de/video/thema/c't-uplink), [#heiseshow](https://www.heise.de/thema/%23heiseshow), and [The World Today
](http://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/worldtoday/episodes/) podcasts. I invite you to subscribe to my daily [Hacker News](https://anchor.fm/orschiro) podcast. You can support me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/orschiro).
