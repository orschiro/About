## Vision
Being mindful, [consuming sustainably](http://scorai.org/), sleeping and living sufficiently, as well as having enough perceived timeâ€“in an imagined [degrowth](https://degrowth.org/) society that is purposefully aided by [digital technology](http://sheetgo.com/).

I love spending time contributing to open-source projects, listening to podcasts, reading weekly newsletters and playing the guitar. You can subscribe to my daily [Hacker News](https://anchor.fm/orschiro) technology podcast and support me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/orschiro) if you like the show. I also record regular [Short Stories](https://brainbeing.wordpress.com/) to connect the brain and being. Lastly, my guitar keeps a [Diary of 6 Strings](https://diaryofsixstrings.wordpress.com/).
