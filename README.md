## My mission
Being mindful, [consuming sustainably](http://scorai.org/), sleeping and living sufficiently, as well as having enough timeâ€“in an imagined [degrowth](https://degrowth.org/) society that is purposefully aided by [digital technology](http://sheetgo.com/).

I recommend reading the weekly [On Being The Pause](https://onbeing.org/newsletter/) and [Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/) newsletter as well as listening to my daily [Hacker News](https://anchor.fm/orschiro) podcast.
