## My mission
Being mindful, [consuming sustainably](http://scorai.org/), sleeping and living sufficiently, as well as having enough perceived timeâ€“in an imagined [degrowth](https://degrowth.org/) society that is purposefully aided by [digital technology](http://sheetgo.com/).

I spend time reading newspapers. I recommend the weekly [On Being The Pause](https://onbeing.org/newsletter/) and [Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/) newsletters, as well as the bi-weekly [c't Magazin](https://www.heise.de/ct/). I enjoy listening to the podcasts [On Being](https://onbeing.org/), [c't uplink](https://www.heise.de/video/thema/c't-uplink), and [#heiseshow](https://www.heise.de/thema/%23heiseshow). I invite you to subscribe to my daily [Hacker News](https://anchor.fm/orschiro) and regular [Brain Being](https://brainbeing.wordpress.com/) podcasts.
